# ToDoList with React

I created this project with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Application was developed using [React JS Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8) by [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA)

## Functionality to Be Added
1. Login.
2. Date-time should be real date-time.
3. Date & time can be selected via fancy interface, not just typed in.
