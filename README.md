# ToDoList with React

I created this project with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Application was developed using [React JS Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8) by [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA)

## Functionality to Be Added
1. Connect tasks with the users. So the users will see their tasks only.
2. Display user's name after authorization.
3. Add "TaskDetails" component.
4. Allow to change day & time on the task.
